Front end for the BEES II Dev and QA tool
## Requirements

* NodeJs 20.11.01 (Or newer)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Alternatively, run `npm run start` and it will have the same result.

## Connecting to Back End
By default, this app will try to make requests to `localhost:8080`, however, you can change that
in this file: `src/environments/environment.development.ts`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Further help
